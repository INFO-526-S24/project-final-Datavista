## Introduction {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Introduction to Data Breaches Definition: A data breach refers to the unauthorized access, disclosure, or acquisition of sensitive or confidential information. It occurs when cybercriminals gain access to a system or network and extract valuable data without authorization.

-   Impact: Data breaches lead to financial losses, reputational damage, legal issues, and privacy breaches for individuals, businesses, and organizations. They also erode trust among stakeholders, leading to long-term consequences.
:::

## Data set

::: incremental
-   Data_Breaches_LATEST.CSV The "World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks" dataset from informationisbeautiful.net spans from 2003 to 2023, providing key details such as year, date, sector, method, and data sensitivity for analyzing breach trends and impacts across sectors.
-   Examples of key variables in this data set are: -Organisation -Records Lost. -Year -Date -Sector -Method -Data Sensitivity
:::

## Project Approach

::: incremental
-Data Collection: Obtain "World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks" dataset from informationisbeautiful.net (2003-2023) with variables: organization, records lost, year, date, sector, method, and data sensitivity.

-Data Cleaning: Ensure integrity by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover breach patterns and trends using statistical methods and visualizations.

-Model Development: Create ML models (classification/regression) to predict breaches or assess severity with key data features.

## Question 1

::: incremental
Visualizing Information Breaches: A Multifaceted Approach (2013-2023)

-Utilizing diverse visualizations: Employing 3D scatter plots, time series analysis, and animations.

-3D Scatter Plot: Detailed visualization using Plotly.

-Time Series Analysis: Utilizing ggplot2 for temporal trends.
