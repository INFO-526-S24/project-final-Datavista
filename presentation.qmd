## Introduction

::: incremental
-   Introduction to Data Breaches Definition: A data breach refers to the unauthorized access, disclosure, or acquisition of sensitive or confidential information. It occurs when cybercriminals gain access to a system or network and extract valuable data without authorization.

-   Impact: Data breaches lead to financial losses, reputational damage, legal issues, and privacy breaches for individuals, businesses, and organizations. They also erode trust among stakeholders, leading to long-term consequences.
:::

## Data set

::: incremental
-   **Data_Breaches_LATEST.CSV** The "World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks" dataset from **informationisbeautiful.net** spans from 2003 to 2023, providing key details such as year, date, sector, method, and data sensitivity for analyzing breach trends and impacts across sectors.
-   Examples of key variables in this data set are: **-Organisation -Records Lost. -Year -Date -Sector -Method -Data Sensitivity**
:::

## Project Approach

::: incremental
-   Data Collection: Obtain "World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks" dataset from **informationisbeautiful.net (2003-2023)** with variables: organization, records lost, year, date, sector, method, and data sensitivity.

-   **Data Cleaning:** Ensure integrity by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates.

-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover breach patterns and trends using statistical methods and visualizations.
:::

## Question 1

**(General Assessment)**

-   How have information breaches advanced over past decade(2013-2023), and what are the patterns with respect to their recurrence, seriousness, and affect over distinctive businesses?

```{r fig.width = 4, fig.asp = 0.5 }


#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#

# Loading the CSV data
data <- read.csv("data/Data_Breaches_LATEST.csv")

# Renaming the column with extra spaces
names(data)[names(data) == 'year   '] <- 'year'

# Filtering data for the past decade (2013-2023)
df_decade <- data[data$year >= 2013 & data$year <= 2023, ]

# Cleaning column names using janitor::clean_names()
df_decade <- janitor::clean_names(df_decade)

# Aggregating sector categories
df_decade$sector <- ifelse(df_decade$sector %in% c("academic", "finance", "government", "health", "military", "tech","web","technology"), df_decade$sector, "other")


# Aggregating method categories
df_decade$method <- ifelse(df_decade$method %in% c("hacked", "inside job", "lost device", "poor security"), df_decade$method, "other")

# Aggregating data by year, sector, and method
agg_data <- aggregate(records_lost ~ year + sector + method, data = df_decade, FUN = sum)

# Creating a 3D plot

#### Insights

**Visualizing Information Breaches: A Multifaceted Approach (2013-2023)**

-   Utilizing diverse visualizations: Employing 3D scatter plots, time series analysis, and animations.

-   3D Scatter Plot: Detailed visualization using Plotly.

-   Time Series Analysis: Utilizing ggplot2 for temporal trends.

#### Time Trend

```{r fig.width = 5,fig.asp = 1}
#| label: Total breaches
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=6, fig.height=2) 
knitr::include_graphics("images/total_plot.gif")

```

#### Sector Trend

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.asp = .618}
#| label: Breaches by sector
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=6, fig.height=2) 
knitr::include_graphics("images/sector_group_plot.gif")
```

#### Insights

-   **Vulnerable Sectors:** Sectors with consistently higher breach lines or sudden spikes in the facet plot might be more susceptible and require additional security measures.

-   **Year-to-Year Fluctuations:** Identifying sectors with significant year-to-year variations in breaches can help focus resources on those sectors during periods of heightened risk.

-   **Overall Security Landscape:** The overall trend in total breaches can indicate a broader improvement or decline in data security practices over time.

## Question 2

(Vulnerability Assessment)

Which sectors or types of data (e.g., personal, financial) are particularly susceptible to different breach methods like hacking or insider jobs, and what are the consequential impacts on both businesses and individuals?

## Question 2

::: panel-tabset
#### Plot A

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.asp = .618 }

#| warning: false

library(plotly)
library(dplyr)

agg_data_sum <- agg_data %>%
  group_by(sector, method) %>%
  summarise(records_lost = sum(records_lost), .groups = 'drop')

fig <- plot_ly(data = agg_data_sum,
               x = ~sector, 
               y = ~records_lost,
               type = 'bar',

                             method,
                             '<br>Records Lost:',
                             records_lost)) %>%
  layout(
    barmode = 'stack',
    title = 'Breach Methods by Sector/Type of Data',
    xaxis = list(title = 'Sector/Type'),
    yaxis = list(title = 'Records Lost'),
    margin = list(b = 150),
    showlegend = TRUE
  ) %>%
  config(displayModeBar = TRUE)

fig <- fig %>% layout(

  paper_bgcolor = 'rgba(245, 246, 249, 1)', 
  plot_bgcolor = 'rgba(245, 246, 249, 1)',
  yaxis = list(
    automargin = TRUE,
    tickfont = list(size = 10),
    titlefont = list(size = 15)
  ),
  xaxis = list(
    automargin = TRUE,
    tickangle = -45, 
    tickfont = list(size = 10),
    titlefont = list(size = 15)

fig <- fig %>% layout(
  xaxis = list(
    rangeslider = list(
      visible = TRUE
    ),
    type = "category"
  )
)

fig

```

#### Insights

-   Dominant Breach Methods: By observing the height of each stacked bar segment within a sector, you can identify the methods responsible for the most significant data loss in that sector.
-   Vulnerability Across Sectors: By comparing the total heights of stacked bars across different sectors, you can see which sectors experienced the most significant data loss overall, potentially suggesting higher vulnerability.

```

#### Insights

-   Year-to-Year Comparison: By observing the lines for each year, you can identify sectors where breach methods and the number of records lost fluctuate significantly.
-   Evolving Trends: You can see if specific methods become more or less prominent over time within a sector, potentially indicating a shift in attacker tactics or changing vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

::: incremental
-   Identifying Sector Weaknesses: We pinpointed industries most vulnerable to cyberattacks, like healthcare and finance. These sectors require immediate security upgrades.

-   Prioritizing Breach Severity: We distinguished between minor leaks and data floods. Focusing on breaches with the most sensitive or critical data is crucial.
