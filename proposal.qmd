# Introduction:
:::

In the ever-evolving realm of cybersecurity, the year 2023 marked a watershed moment, as revealed by [The Identity Theft Research Center's (ITRC)]{style="color:blue"} Annual Data Breach Report. With a staggering 72% increase over the previous record set in 2021, the United States witnessed an unprecedented surge in data compromises, impacting over 353 million individuals. This alarming trend underscores the urgent need for heightened vigilance and robust security measures in safeguarding our digital assets. In our project, we will delve into the World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks to gain valuable insights into these incidents and explore strategies to mitigate future risks

```

The "World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks" dataset, sourced from [informationisbeautiful.net](https://informationisbeautiful.net/), focuses on cataloging data breaches across various sectors. Key columns such as year, date, sector, method, and data sensitivity provide avenues for in-depth analysis. Spanning from 2003 to 2023, the dataset offers a comprehensive view of breaches over time.

Sectors covered include academic, app, finance, gaming, government, health, legal, military, and miscellaneous. Methods of breach encompass hacking, inside job, lost device, accidental exposure (oops), and poor security practices. Additionally, the dataset contains information on breaches affecting top companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and others.

## Questions
:::

Q1) [General Assessment:]{style="color:blue;"} How have data breaches evolved over past decade(2013-2023), and what are the trends regarding their frequency, severity, and impact across different industries ?

Q2) [Vulnerability Assessment:]{style="color:blue;"} Which sectors or types of data (e.g., personal, financial) are most vulnerable to specific methods of breach (e.g., hacking, insider job)? How can organizations prioritize their security efforts based on this analysis?

::: {style="background-color: #002366; color: white; line-height: normal; padding: 0 6px;"}
## Analysis plan
:::

### QUESTION 1:

To solve this question we will use columns: [Method]{style="color:blue;"}, [Sector]{style="color:blue;"}, [Sensitivity]{style="color:blue;"}, [Records Lost]{style="color:blue;"}, [Year]{style="color:blue;"}

The steps are:

-   **Data Preprocessing:**

    -   Clean and organize the provided data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

    -   Focus on relevant columns such as records lost, method, year, sector, data sensitivity, and displayed records. Ensure the dataset covers the entire timeframe from 2004 to 2023.

-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

    -   Calculate summary statistics for key variables like records lost to understand the overall scale of breaches.
    -   Visualize trends in the frequency of breaches over time using a line plot or bar chart. - Identify any outliers or anomalies in the data that may warrant further investigation.

-   **Trend Analysis:**

    -   Analyze trends in breach severity by examining the distribution of records lost and displayed records over time.

    -   Evaluate variations in breach frequency and severity across different sectors and regions.

-   **Visualization and Interpretation:**

    -   We will utilize [Shiny]{style="color:blue;"} , a robust R package, to construct an [interactive dashboard]{style="color:blue;"} for data visualization.

    -   Design a user-friendly interface incorporating dropdown menus, sliders, and checkboxes for seamless data filtering and selection.

    -   Utilize ggplot2 to create visually appealing representations of key metrics such as breach frequency over time, distribution of records lost by sector, and trends in breach severity.

    -   Implement interactive elements like hover tooltips, clickable legends, and zoom functionality to enhance user engagement and enable detailed exploration of the data.

    -   If [\*]{style="color:red;"} applicable-(Data breaches generally occur in companies that span multiple regions.) incorporate maps to visually display the geographical distribution of data breaches and their impacts across different regions. -Provide deeper insights by including textual descriptions, annotations, or pop-up messages highlighting significant findings and offering insights into the implications of data breaches for cybersecurity strategies.

[ \*]{style="color:red;"} (Data breaches generally occur in companies that span multiple regions.)

### QUESTION 2:

To address this Vulnerability Assessment we will use columns: [Method]{style="color:blue;"}, [Sector]{style="color:blue;"}, [Sensitivity]{style="color:blue;"}, [Records Lost]{style="color:blue;"}, [Year]{style="color:blue;"}

we'll follow these steps:

-  **Data Preprocessing**:

   -Clean the data to remove any inconsistencies or missing values.

   -Ensure data types are appropriate for analysis.

-  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

    - Analyze the relationships between breach [methods]{style="color:blue;"} and [sectors]{style="color:blue;"}/types of data using the "method" and "sector" columns.

     - Calculate frequency counts or percentages to identify vulnerabilities.

     - Explore distributions and correlations between variables such as "[data sensitivity]{style="color:blue;"}" and "[records lost]{style="color:blue;"}".

-  **Trend Analysis**:

    - Investigate trends in breach occurrence over time using the "[year]{style="color:blue;"}" column.

     - Identify patterns or anomalies in breach methods and affected sectors/types of data over time.
